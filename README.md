MSc(Final) Complex Systems and Networks Project, Department of Physics and Astrophysics, Delhi University, November 2022


The field of Complex systems and Networks is an exciting, challenging, and growing sub-
ject. It has applications in almost every field from Economics, Cellular Biology, Computer
science, Sociology to Physics and Cosmology. It is a realistic and interdisciplinary subject
which can be used to solve real life problems in a very efficient way. It stands on the pillars
of Mathematics and Computer science. The subject investigates the relationships between
the elements of the problem, simplifies the problem by converting it into mathematical
expressions, and provides computational solutions to the problem

We are given dataset from https://www.power.scigrid.de/. It has information about
power stations from Germany. The dataset has Power station number, voltage, cables,
wires, frequency, name of the operator, length of wires, etc. We’ll first clean the data and
then plot the data. While plotting the data we are going to make sure that the nodes are
placed at the exact longitude and latitude location. This way we’ll be able to locate the
nodes and directions while developing the attack strategy. One amazing thing which we
observed while marking the exact point is that the German Power grid is spanned in nearby
countries as well. For example, one of the power station is seen in Denmark and indeed the
co-ordinates of it on maps points to a power station. Although it is for a shorter distance
and for nearby countries only. In order to visualize various properties of the network, we plotted the network and used
network visualization tools.
